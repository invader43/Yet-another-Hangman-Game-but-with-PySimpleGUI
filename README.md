# Hangman_gui
The goal is to create a hangman single player game using pysimplegui .
The gui seems to work for now , test.py is the file for running the game in gui mode and core.py for running it in cli mode . The code structure for now seems to be very bad , soon will be improved with commits . Executable for windows will be available for project is completed.
